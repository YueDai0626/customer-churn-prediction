## Dataset

- Demo dataset used for workflow illustration
- 891 observations
- 15 features
- Binary classification problem (Churn / Not Churn)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Stratified K-Fold Cross-validation

## Project Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Feature encoding (Label Encoding)  
4. Train-test split (80/20)  
5. Random Forest classifier training  
6. Model evaluation  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report  
7. 5-fold Cross-validation
